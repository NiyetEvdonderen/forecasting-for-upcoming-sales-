#  Appliance Sales Forecasting with Time Series (ARIMA)
This project provides a simple yet effective method to forecast the **next month's sales** for three major home appliances:

- Washing Machines  
- Dishwashers  
- Refrigerators  

The data is assumed to be **monthly sales figures**, and the forecasting is done using **ARIMA models** from the `statsmodels` library.
